# System Design
## Steps
- Step 1: Requirements clarifications
  - Functional Requirements
  - Non-Functional Requirements
  - Extended Requirements
- Step 2: Back-of-the-envelope estimation
  - Traffic estimates(QPS)
  - Storage estimates
  - Bandwidth estimates - Incoming&Outgoing
  - Memory estimates(most frequently used content)
  - High-Level estimates
- Step 3: System API definition
- Step 4: Defining data model
- Step 5: High-level design
- Step 6: Detailed design
- Step 7: Identifying and resolving bottlenecks

## KeyTerm
- QPS - Query Per Second
- DAU - Daily Active Users
- MAU - Monthly Active Users
- LRU - Least Recently Used
